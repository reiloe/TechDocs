# Docker

Docker provides the ability to package and run an application in a loosely isolated environment called a container.

The isolation and security allows you to run many containers simultaneously on a given host. Containers are lightweight and contain everything needed to run the application, so you do not need to rely on what is currently

installed on the host. You can easily share containers while you work, and be sure that everyone you share with gets the same container that works in the same way.

A container<br>will always run the same, regardless of the infrastructure.<br>Containers isolate software from its environment and ensure<br>that it works uniformly despite differences for instance between<br>development and staging. |
